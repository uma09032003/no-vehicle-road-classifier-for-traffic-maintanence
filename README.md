# no-vehicle-road-detector-for-traffic-maintanence
The no-vehicle-road detector model, detects the presence of vehicle within the field of view of the camera from the captured image. It helps to monitor the traffic signal, manage the maintenance of the signals, etc. This simple Convolutional Neural Network has been trained using limited images for project demonstration.
